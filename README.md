This is a handy ruby script used for remote backups over ssh.

*) reads a list of servers and directories from a yaml file 
*) mirrors them to the current directory via rsync 
*) runs rdiff-backup (http://rdiff-backup.nongnu.org/) creating a rdiff-backup directory
which can be queried for incremental backups.
